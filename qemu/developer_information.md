# QEMU developer information

- If you wish to implement a new hardware mode you will want to read through the QEMU Object Model (QOM) [QOM](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/devel/qom.html#qom).
- Those wishing to enhance or add new CPU emulation capabilities will want to read [TCG Emulation](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/devel/index-tcg.html#tcg) documentation, especially the overview of the [Translator Internals](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/devel/tcg.html#tcg-internals).
