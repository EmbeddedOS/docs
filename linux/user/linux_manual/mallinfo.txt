1. NAME   
    mallinfo, mallinfo2 - obtain memory allocation information
	   
2. SYNOPSIS
    #include <malloc.h>

    struct mallinfo mallinfo(void);
    struct mallinfo2 mallinfo2(void);


3. DESCRIPTION 
	+  These functions return a copy of a structure \
		containing information about memory allocations performed by malloc() \
		and related functions.
		
	+ The structure returned by each function contains the same fields.
	+ The mallinfo2 structure returned by mallinfo2() is defined as follows:
		struct mallinfo2 {
            size_t arena;     /* Non-mmapped space allocated (bytes) */
            size_t ordblks;   /* Number of free chunks */
            size_t smblks;    /* Number of free fastbin blocks */
            size_t hblks;     /* Number of mmapped regions */
            size_t hblkhd;    /* Space allocated in mmapped regions
                                 (bytes) */
            size_t usmblks;   /* See below */
            size_t fsmblks;   /* Space in freed fastbin blocks (bytes) */
            size_t uordblks;  /* Total allocated space (bytes) */
            size_t fordblks;  /* Total free space (bytes) */
            size_t keepcost;  /* Top-most, releasable space (bytes) */
        };
