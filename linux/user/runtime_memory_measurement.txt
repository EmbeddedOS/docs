+ This page has a collection of ideas and resources having to to with measure runtime memory of a Linux system.
+ Unfortunately, the existing memory measurement techniques do not give a 100% accurate accounting of memory pages \
	(since some pages are counted more than once by some measures). 
	
1. Measuring memory in Linux (the basics)
	+ Here are some basic techniques for measuring memory usage in Linux.
	1.1. free and /proc

2. Measuring user process memory use:
	2.5. Heap memory usage:
		+ Heap is the dynamically allocated memory inside each process's address space \
			that is managed by the application ITSELF. \
			The structure of this memory is actually managed by the C library, with the application calling malloc() and free().
			
		+ glibc has the capability to collect statistivs information of heap functions like malloc() \
			And the other functions like memory leak checking or double free.
