+ Several tools exist for finding memory leaks or for reporting individual memory allocations of a program. \
	These tools help analyze memory usage patterns, detect unbalanced allocations and frees, report buffer over- and under-runs, etc.
	
1. mtrace:
	+ mtrace is a builtin part of glibc which allows detection of memory leaks \
		caused by unbalanced malloc/free calls. 
	
	+ To use it, \
		The program is modified to call mtrace() and muntrace() to start and stop tracing of allocations. \
		A log file is created, wich can then be scanned by the 'mtrace' Perl script.
	
	+ The 'mtrace' program lists only unbalanced allocations. \
		If source is available it can show the source line where the problem occurred. \
		mtrace can be used on both C and C++ programs.
