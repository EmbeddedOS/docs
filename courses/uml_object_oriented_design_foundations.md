# UML Object Oriented Design foundations

## I. Introduction

### 1. What's covered in this course?

- Topics:
  - Project Management Foundations.
  - Core Object Orientation Concepts.
  - Object-oriented analysis and design.
  - Essential UML Diagrams.
  - Challenges and Quizzes.
  - Case study: Designing a Note-Taking App.

### 2. Tools and Prerequisites

- Tool: StarUML.

## II. Software Project Management Foundations

### 4. Why you shouldn't skip this module?

- Software development requires structure.

### 5. Water falls vs Agile: Software development approaches

- Water falls like building a house. require pre-defined of everything.
- Agile changes friendly and responsive.

### 6. The Waterfall Model

- The development process flows in cascades.
- Each phase builds upon the previous one.
- Phases:
  1. Collect & Analyze requirements.
  2. Architecture definition.
  3. Implementation.
  4. Verification.
  5. Maintenance.
- Use the waterfall if the requirements are clear and won't change frequently. For example: Life-control systems, Medical system, Military systems, etc.

### 7. Agile Manifesto

- Aimed to end the proliferation of software development methodologies.
- 4 key values:
  1. Individual and interactions over processes and tools.
  2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  4. Responding to change over following a plan.

- Sprints and Reviews: sprint each 2 or 4 weeks.
- Each sprints have their own phases: design, implementation, testing, etc.
- Agile is a way of thinking.

### 8. Waterfall or Agile?

- Can we define requirements in advance?
  - Yes -> Waterfall.
  - No -> Agile.

- Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear requirements and fixed scope.
- Choose Agile if requirements are unstable and may changed frequently.

## III. Core Object-oriented concepts

### 9. A brief history of programming

- 1950: Non-structured programming.
  - Sequentially ordered instructions.
  - Numbered code lines.
