Linux user space debugging

1. GDB:
	1.1. What is GDB ?
		+ GDB stands for GNU Debugger which helps you to debug your binary object file created in compilation process.
		+ GDB allows to you see what happening in your program which really helps much when program crashes, \
			especially when segmentation fault occurs.
			
			
	1.2. Some uses of gdb:
		+ Step through a program line by line.
		+ Set breakpoints that will stop your program.
		+ Make your program stop on specified conditions.
		+ Show the present values of variables.
		+ Examine the contents of any frame on the call stack.
		
	1.3. Languages supported by GDB:
		+ Ada, Assembly, C, C++, D, Fortran, Go, etc.
		
	1.4. How to compile a program to use with gdb.
		'gcc -g -o binary_file source_file'
		
		+ '-g' tell the compiler to store symbol table information in the executable.
		+ This includes:
			+ Symbol names.
			+ Type info for symbols.
			+ Files and line numbers where the symbols came from.
		+ Tip: Check the size of binary with and without debugging symbols.
