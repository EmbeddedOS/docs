# ARM Architecture Overview: ARM-v7-A and ARM-v8-A

## I. Registers

### 1. Arm-v7-A: Introducing registers

- General-purpose registers: R0~R15 (PC)
  - Used as input or output to assembly instruction.
  - Represent the execution flow of process.

- CPSR, SPSRs:
  - Conditional flags.
  - Exception bit mask.
  - Processor mode.
  - Control the execution of exception flow.

## 2. Exception Level: Introduction to Exception level in ARMv8
