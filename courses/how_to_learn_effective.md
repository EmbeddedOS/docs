# How to learn effective approaches for self-guided learning

## I. Introduction

### 1. Welcome

Understand how people learn help you learn better.
This course introduce some basic things:

- What is learning? learning is not just passively taking information, it's much more than that.
- Motivation, components of self motivation.
- Goals, structure what you want to archive.
- Practice and application.
- Reflection.
- Making learning social, how you can learn with and from other.
- Memory, make learning into a habit.

### 2. What is learning?

Learning is **a process that results in a change in knowledge or behavior as a result of some experience**.

- Result of learning is **a change**: People want learn new things so they can **DO** new things.
- Learning is **A process**, is not like we download something and install in your brain, we are not a computer.

### 3. Different theories of learning

- 1. Behaviorism.
  - **Behaviorist** view of learning:
    - Repetition of the desired behavior/information.
    - Increment progression of tasks.
    - Continuous positive reinforcement.
- 2. Constructivism.
  - Knowledge is something you actively construct for yourself. It's not something you passively absorb into an empty space in your head.
  - **Constructivist** view of learning:
    - Actively interpreting and assimilated new information into existing mental models.
    - Actively transforming those mental models as you encounter new information.
  - Learning requires explanation, reflection, and consideration.
    - Not just memorization. Memorization is just short-term strategy to learn very particular things.
  - All learning take place in cultural contexts involving social interactions.

- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**:
  - ZPD is a way that describes a child's development level, not just in terms of what the child's development can do independently, but in term a of what the child's development can do with help. The idea is that, they could not be successful by themselves.

- Learning as enculturation.
- **Culture** is:
  - The set of rules and beliefs that describe what a group of people know and how they do things.

- Look back to learning definition, now, the question is: Are your experience leading you to change in the way you want to change? So what culture (a group) you want to be a part of?

- The idea is simple, if you want to be something or someone else, surround your self with the people who are that. So you'll do things in the way they do things, so you can learn from them.

### 4. The basic secrets to learning

To be an effective learner:

- 1. Choose what matters.
- 2. Do what matters.
- 3. Get helps.

The best advice: **YOU NEED TO START**.

### 5. Activity: Get started

- Did you start your course? now answer these questions like **Course Reflection**:
  - What have you learned so far?
  - How does this relate to what you ultimately want to be able to do?
  - Is there anything not covered that you may need to learn elsewhere?

- Learning Experience Reflection:
  - Describe your learning experience. What were you learning, and what were you doing to learn it?
    - The course I learnt recently is Embedded Design Pattern, I learn patterns one by one each day (30 minutes to watch - 3 hours to understand). I wrote everything I learn and submitted to github, I also tried apply to our real code.
  - Why were you learning it?
    - It's improve my mindset to design software architecture.
  - What about this experience made it your favorite? Why was it impactful and memorable?
    - Because it's my passion, I want to learn to get better.
- Apply your Learning Experience worksheet to learning new things.

## II. Motivation

### 6. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

A motivation is the drive to perform an action. Two types of motivation: Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.

- Extrinsic Motivation: When we do something for rewards that are external to the action we're taking (grades, money, praise, social status).
- Intrinsic Motivation: When the action itself is reason enough to do it (games, hobbits, enjoy doing sports).

If you identify why you want to learn something, it can help you succeed at learning it.

### 7. Autonomous motivation & 3 core psychological needs

Self-determinatic theory (SDT), Human have 3 core psychological needs:

- Competence: The feeling that you are be able, effective at the things you do.
- Relatedness: The feeling that you connected to others.
- Autonomy: The feeing that you are the source of your actions.

What if you're trying to learn something that you don't really want to learn? Instead, try to answer this: How is what you're learning meaningful to you? That may make your motivation.

### 8. Activity: What motivates you?

Stop and think about why you are motivated to learn? For example you have a bunch of Udemy course to learn, what course you choose to learn first? What motivates you the most?

1. Why did you choose to learn this topic? Is it out of a personal interest? Is it for work?
2. What motivates you about the topic? Is it primarily intrinsic or extrinsic?
3. What will this learning help you do and why does that matter to you?

## III. Setting Learning Goals

### 9. Why set goals?

Goals provide direction so that you can truly focus on the outcomes you want to archive.
Setting a goal that's personal and valuable will motivate you.
Settings goals impacts the likelihood of actually getting what you want.

Why set goals?

- Goals help you define and envision what you want to accomplish.
- Goals can keep you motivated and on track.
- Goals make it more likely that you'll actually do what you set out to do.

### 10. What are GOOD learning Goals?

- It's something you're motivated by.
- It's meaningful to you and drives impact in your life.
- It's focused on an authentic, real-world outcome.

- In other word, you should choose the learning goals that matter to you. For example: The Goals are not just finish some courses.
- Focus on what your learning will help you personally achieve.

### 11. How to Set Learning Goals?

- I'd like to you the **SMART** framework:
  - **S** - Specific: Don't make goal with vague words like: good at st, master of st, etc. We need to specific here with a particular outcome. For example: learning python code to **develop a web system using python**.
  - **M** - Measurable: measurable by time, you produce something like: a web system in a month, divide smaller like: frontend in 2 week, backend in 2 week.
  - **A** - Attainable: Don't set some impossible goals out of the learning path, like: learn python and machine learning in a month.
  - **R** - Relevant: The goal should be meaningful to you and connected to your value or higher level: work, relation, mindset, etc.
  - **T** - Time-Based: Give yourself a deadline to do it.

- A goal, for example when we combine every properties: By march 31, I will use Adobe Illustrator (and what I learned in my Udemy course) to create 1 header image and 1 logo for our Q2 company newsletter.

### 12. Activity: Set your learning goals

- Your watch Udemy course for a reason, what is this? what do want to archive?
- And when you have a general goals, apply SMART structure into it.
  - Make it specific: clearly state of particular action you be able to do by completing this course.
  - Make it measurable: how do you complete the goal? measure something before-after to see the **changes**.
  - Make it attainable: be sure it's possible for you.
  - Make it Relevant: Is this somethings really matter to you at work, at life, etc?
  - Make it Time-based: make yourself a realistic deadline. Consider the time you need to dedicate the learning goal.

- When you have the goal: write it down: put it to some where you can see it often.

## IV. Practice and Application

### 13. Learning is DOING

For example, you want to learn Tennis, you watching video how to play it. If you just watching it, you'll just good at **WATCHING** not **PLAYING**. Everything need **PRACTICING**.

Does what you do when you're learning look like what you do when you're applying?

### 14. Get specific with learning objectives

Learning objectives answer the question: What should be able to do if you complete a learning experience?

### 15. Activity: Go practice

Look at the course the you taking, and identify where there are opportunities to practice.
Define some authentic tasks for yourself based on your learning goal.

## V. Reflection

### 16. Why reflect?

- When you finish a learning section, you can stop and ask questions about what have you learnt.
- Think critically about what we're learning:
  - Actively connect new information to existing knowledge.
  - Ask questions about what we know and what we don't.

### 17. Reflection for motivation and learning

- If motivation is flagging, reflect on why you're learning.
- Reflecting on what you're experiencing makes you an active participant in your learning.
- Try to understand, not only remember things.

### 18. Reflect on What You've Learned

- What is the most surprising thing you've learned so far?
- Which topic or concept has been most difficult?
- What other information or practice might you need here?
- What questions do you have about the material or how to apply it?

- Reflect on your learning goal:
  - What have you learned that's brought you closer to your goal?
  - What else do you still need to learn in order to achieve it?

## VI. Learning with others

### 19. Don't learn Alone

- Just about everything we do, we do with others.
- When students collaborate on class projects they learn the material better.
- People tend to perform better when other people are around.
- The most fundamental mechanism of learning is feedback.
- Collaborative or shared work can be very motivating.
- Doing things with others can be fun.

### 20. What you need others to Do?

- Get someone to learn with you.
- Ask someone to be an accountability partner.
- Take on the role of instructor and teach your accountability partner.

### 21. Who should you Learn with?

- Learn with someone who cares about you and your learning.
- Learning with and from others:
  - Exposes you to different perspectives and ideas.
  - Helps broaden your understanding.

### 22. Find your learning buddy and community

- Find someone you personally know to be a part of your learning.
- See if anyone want to take your course with you.
- Look outside your immediate network to find another source of learning.

## 7. Put Learning on Repeat

### 23. Repetition and Memory

- Doing something repeatedly helps make it an automatic process.
- Repetition is important when we practice and apply our learning.
- Memory consists of three process:
  - 1. Encoding: Encoding is the process of turning information into a memory.
  - 2. Storage: Refers to how an encoded memory is held in the brain.
  - 3. Retrieval: Retrieval occurs when you need to access previously stored information.

- Try to connect new information to existing information to improve encoding.
- Acronyms or mnemonic devices.
- Practice generating the things you want to remember using cues.

### 24. Make Learning on Ongoing Habit

- Repetition helps us build habits.
- Making learning an ongoing habit starts by defining and prioritizing learning time.
- Start small.
- Schedule regular and repeated time with yourself to learn.

### 25. Activity: Schedule Your Learning Time

- If you want archive your goal in a period time, think about how much time you'll need for various learning activities.
- Schedule events with yourself to complete these activities.
