# How to learn effective approaches for self-guided learning

## I. Introduction

### 1. Welcome

Understand how people learn help you learn better.
This course introduce some basic things:

- What is learning? learning is not just passively taking information, it's much more than that.
- Motivation, components of self motivation.
- Goals, structure what you want to archive.
- Practice and application.
- Reflection.
- Making learning social, how you can learn with and from other.
- Memory, make learning into a habit.

### 2. What is learning?

Learning is **a process that results in a change in knowledge or behavior as a result of some experience**.

- Result of learning is **a change**: People want learn new things so they can **DO** new things.
- Learning is **A process**, is not like we download something and install in your brain, we are not a computer.

### 3. Different theories of learning

- 1. Behaviorism.
  - **Behaviorist** view of learning:
    - Repetition of the desired behavior/information.
    - Increment progression of tasks.
    - Continuous positive reinforcement.
- 2. Constructivism.
  - Knowledge is something you actively construct for yourself. It's not something you passively absorb into an empty space in your head.
  - **Constructivist** view of learning:
    - Actively interpreting and assimilated new information into existing mental models.
    - Actively transforming those mental models as you encounter new information.
  - Learning requires explanation, reflection, and consideration.
    - Not just memorization. Memorization is just short-term strategy to learn very particular things.
  - All learning take place in cultural contexts involving social interactions.

- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**:
  - ZPD is a way that describes a child's development level, not just in terms of what the child's development can do independently, but in term a of what the child's development can do with help. The idea is that, they could not be successful by themselves.

- Learning as enculturation.
- **Culture** is:
  - The set of rules and beliefs that describe what a group of people know and how they do things.

- Look back to learning definition, now, the question is: Are your experience leading you to change in the way you want to change? So what culture (a group) you want to be a part of?

- The idea is simple, if you want to be something or someone else, surround your self with the people who are that. So you'll do things in the way they do things, so you can learn from them.

### 4. The basic secrets to learning

To be an effective learner:

- 1. Choose what matters.
- 2. Do what matters.
- 3. Get helps.

The best advice: **YOU NEED TO START**.

### 5. Activity: Get started

- Did you start your course? now answer these questions like **Course Reflection**:
  - What have you learned so far?
  - How does this relate to what you ultimately want to be able to do?
  - Is there anything not covered that you may need to learn elsewhere?

- Learning Experience Reflection:
  - Describe your learning experience. What were you learning, and what were you doing to learn it?
    - The course I learnt recently is Embedded Design Pattern, I learn patterns one by one each day (30 minutes to watch - 3 hours to understand). I wrote everything I learn and submitted to github, I also tried apply to our real code.
  - Why were you learning it?
    - It's improve my mindset to design software architecture.
  - What about this experience made it your favorite? Why was it impactful and memorable?
    - Because it's my passion, I want to learn to get better.
- Apply your Learning Experience worksheet to learning new things.

## II. Motivation

### 6. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

A motivation is the drive to perform an action. Two types of motivation: Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.

- Extrinsic Motivation: When we do something for rewards that are external to the action we're taking (grades, money, praise, social status).
- Intrinsic Motivation: When the action itself is reason enough to do it (games, hobbits, enjoy doing sports).

If you identify why you want to learn something, it can help you succeed at learning it.

### 7. Autonomous motivation & 3 core psychological needs

Self-determinatic theory (SDT), Human have 3 core psychological needs:

- Competence: The feeling that you are be able, effective at the things you do.
- Relatedness: The feeling that you connected to others.
- Autonomy: The feeing that you are the source of your actions.

What if you're trying to learn something that you don't really want to learn? Instead, try to answer this: How is what you're learning meaningful to you? That may make your motivation.

### 8. Activity: What motivates you?

Stop and think about why you are motivated to learn? For example you have a bunch of Udemy course to learn, what course you choose to learn first? What motivates you the most?

1. Why did you choose to learn this topic? Is it out of a personal interest? Is it for work?
2. What motivates you about the topic? Is it primarily intrinsic or extrinsic?
3. What will this learning help you do and why does that matter to you?

## III. Setting Learning Goals

### 9. Why set goals?

Goals provide direction so that you can truly focus on the outcomes you want to archive.
Setting a goal that's personal and valuable will motivate you.
Settings goals impacts the likelihood of actually getting what you want.

Why set goals?

- Goals help you define and envision what you want to accomplish.
- Goals can keep you motivated and on track.
- Goals make it more likely that you'll actually do what you set out to do.
