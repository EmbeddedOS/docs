# How to learn effective approaches for self-guided learning

## I. Introduction

### 1. Welcome

Understand how people learn help you learn better.
This course introduce some basic things:

- What is learning? learning is not just passively taking information, it's much more than that.
- Motivation, components of self motivation.
- Goals, structure what you want to archive.
- Practice and application.
- Reflection.
- Making learning social, how you can learn with and from other.
- Memory, make learning into a habit.

### 2. What is learning?

Learning is **a process that results in a change in knowledge or behavior as a result of some experience**.

- Result of learning is **a change**: People want learn new things so they can **DO** new things.
- Learning is **A process**, is not like we download something and install in your brain, we are not a computer.

### 3. Different theories of learning

- 1. Behaviorism.
  - **Behaviorist** view of learning:
    - Repetition of the desired behavior/information.
    - Increment progression of tasks.
    - Continuous positive reinforcement.
- 2. Constructivism.
  - Knowledge is something you actively construct for yourself. It's not something you passively absorb into an empty space in your head.
  - **Constructivist** view of learning:
    - Actively interpreting and assimilated new information into existing mental models.
    - Actively transforming those mental models as you encounter new information.
  - Learning requires explanation, reflection, and consideration.
    - Not just memorization. Memorization is just short-term strategy to learn very particular things.
  - All learning take place in cultural contexts involving social interactions.

- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**:
  - ZPD is a way that describes a child's development level, not just in terms of what the child's development can do independently, but in term a of what the child's development can do with help. The idea is that, they could not be successful by themselves.

- Learning as enculturation.
- **Culture** is:
  - The set of rules and beliefs that describe what a group of people know and how they do things.

- Look back to learning definition, now, the question is: Are your experience leading you to change in the way you want to change? So what culture (a group) you want to be a part of?

- The idea is simple, if you want to be something or someone else, surround your self with the people who are that. So you'll do things in the way they do things, so you can learn from them.

  - Why were you learning it?
    - It's improve my mindset to design software architecture.
