100 days of code: the complete python pro bootcamp for 2022

4. Day 4 - beginner - randomisation and python lists:
	40. Day 4 goals: what we will make by the end of the day:
	41. Random module:
		+ search all python module: https://www.askpython.com/
		+ So what exactly is the module ? \
			you are seen that we have mostly been writing our code all on the same page in a sort of script style, right ?
			IT is same as including header in C++.
			
		+ random.choice(list)
		+ random.choice(range(10, 101))
			-> random in a list.
			
		+ random.randint(10,100)
			-> random integer.
			
			
	43. Understanding the Offset and Appending Items to Lists
		+ The list is what you would call a data structure. \
			It's just a way of organizing and storing data in Python.
			
		+ Now we have already seen ways of storing single pieces of data, \
			and that was done through the simple variable where we just said \
			a = 3, b = hello ...
			
		+ But sometimes you might want to store grouped pieces of data, \
			data that has some sort of connection with each other. \
			For example, if you wanted to store all of the names of the States in the US \
			then it doesn't really make sense to store them all individually, \
			because they kind of belong together, right ?
			
		+ List:
			fruits = [item1, item2]
			fruits = ["cherry", "Apple", "pear"]
			
	45. Index errors and working with nested lists:
		+ IndexError: list index out of range.
		
5. Python Loops:
	49. Day 5 goals: what we will make by the end of the day.
	50. Using the for Loops with Python lists:
		+ For loop syntax:
			for item in list_of_items:
				#Do something to each item. 
				
6. Python functions & Karel:
	58. Day 6 goals: what we will make by the end of day:
		+ Code Blocks.
		+ Function.
		+ While loops.

16. Day 16 -Intermediate - Object Oriented programming (OOP):
	145. Why do we need OOP and how does it work?
	146. How to uses OOP: classes and objects:
		+
