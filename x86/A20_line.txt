A20 line

+ The A20, or address line 20, is one of the electrical lines that make up the system bus of an x86-based computer system. \
	The A20 line in particular is used to TRANSMIT the 21st bit on the address bus.
	
+ A microprocessor typically has a number of address lines EQUAL to \
	the base-two logarithm of the number of words in its physical address space. \
	
	For example, a processor with 4Gb of byte-addressable physical space requires 32 lines (2^32), \
	which are named A0 though A31.
	
+ The lines are named after the zero-based number of the bit in the address that they are transmitting. 

+ A20 transmit bit 20 (the 21st bit) and becomes active once addresses reach 1MB, or 2^20.


1. Overview:
	+ The Intel 8086, Intel 8088, and Intel 80186 processors had 20 address lines, \
		numbered A0 to A19;\
		with these, the processor can access 220 bytes, or 1 MB.
		
	+ Internal address registers of such processors only had 16 bits. \
		To access a 20-bit address space, \
		an external memory reference was made up of a 16-bit OFFSET address added to a 16-bit SEGMENT number, \
		shifted 4 bits so as to produce a 20-bit physical address. \
		The resulting address is equal to segment × 16 + offset.
		
	+ For example, here are four of the 4096 different segment:offset combinations, \
		all referencing the byte whose physical address is 0x000FFFFF \
		(the last byte in 1 MB-memory space):
		
			F000:FFFF
			FFFF:000F
			F555:AAAF
			F800:7FFF
	
	+ When IBM designed the IBM PC AT(1984) machine, \
		it decided to use the new high-performance Intel 80286 microprocessor. \
		The 80286 could could address UP TO 16MB of system memory PROTECTED MODE. \
		
		However, the CPU was supposed to EMULATE an 8086'S BEHAVIOR in REAL MODE, \
		its startup mode, so that it could run OS and programs that were not written for protected mode. \
		The 80286 did not force the A20 line to zero in real mode, howerver. \
		To remain compatible with such programs, IBM decided to correct the problem on the motherboard.
		
	+ That was accomplished by inserting a logic gate on the A20 line between the processor and system bus, \
		which got named GATE-A20. \
	
	+ Gate-A20 can be enabled or disabled by software to allow \
		or prevent the address bus from receiving a signal from A20. 
		
	+ At boot time, the BIOS first enables Gate-A20 when it counts and tests all of the system memory, \
		and then disables it before transferring control to the operating system.
		
	+ Originally, the logic gate was a gate connected to the Intel 8042 keyboard controller. \
		Controlling it was a relatively slow process. \
		Other methods have since been added to allow more efficient multitasking of programs that require this wrap-around with programs that access all of the system memory. \
		There are multiple methods to control the A20 line.
		
	-> Enabling the Gate-A20 line is one of the first steps that a protected mode x86 OS does in the bootup process, \
		often before control has been passed to the kernel from bootstrap.
		
2. A20 gate:
	+ Controlling the A20 line was an important feature at one stage in the growth of the IBM PC architecture, \
		as it added access to an additional 65,520 bytes (64 KB − 16 bytes) of memory in real mode, \
		without significant software changes.
		
	+ The A20 gate is still present on many modern PCs, \
		and the gate is initially closed right after boot. \
		Modern protected-mode operating systems typically open the A20 gate early during the boot process and NEVER CLOSE it again.
		Such operating systems do not have the compatibility reasons for keeping it closed, \
		and they gain access to the full range of physical addresses available by opening it.
