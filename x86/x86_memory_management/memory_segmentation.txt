Memory segmentation

+ Memory segmentation is an OS memory management technique of division of computer's primary memory \
	into SEGMENTS or SECTIONS.

+ In computer system using segmentation, a reference to a memory location includes \
	a VALUE that identifies a segment and an OFFSET (memory location) within that segment.
	
+ Segments or sections are also used in object files of compiled programs \
	when they are linked together into a program image and when the image is loaded into memory.
	
+ Segments usually correspond to natural divisions of a program such as individual routines or data tables, \
	So segmentation is generally more visible to the programmer than paging alone. \
	Segments may be created for program modules, \
	or for classes of memory usage such as code and data segment. \
	Certain segments may be shared between programs.
	
+ In a x86-64 architecture it is considered legacy and most x86-64 based modern system software \
	DON'T USE memory segmentation. \
	Instead they handle programs and their data by utilizing MEMORY-PAGING which also serves \
	as a way of memory protection.
	
	
1. Hardware implementation:
	+ In a system using segmentation, \
		computer memory addresses consist of a SEGMENT ID and an OFFSET within the segment.
	
	+ Memory Management Unit (MMU) is responsible for translating the segment and offset into a physical address.
		
	+ Each segment has a length and set of permissions (for example, read, write, execute) associated with it. \
		A process is only allowed to make a reference into a segment if the type of reference is allowed by the permissions, \
		and if the offset within the segment is within the range specified by the length of the segment.
		
	+ Segments may also be used to implement virtual memory.
	
	+ Segmentation is one method of implementing memory protection. \
		paging is another, and they can be combined.
		
	+ The size of a memory segment is generally not fixed and may br as small a single byte.
	
	1.1. Segmentation without paging:
		+ Associted with each segment is information that indicates where the segment is located in memory \
			-- segment base. \
			When a program references a memory location, the offset is added to the segment base to generate a physical memory address.
			
			
		
	1.2. Segmentation with paging:
		+ Instead of a memory location, \
			the segment information includes the address of a PAGE TABLE for the segment.
			
		+ when a program reference a memory location the offset is translated to a memory address using the page table. \
			A segment can be extended by allocating another memory page and adding it to the segment's page table.
