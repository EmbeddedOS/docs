X86 Memory models

+ In computing, Intel memory model refers to a set of six different memory models of the x86 CPU in REAL MODE.

1. Memory segmentation:
	+ Four registers are used to refer to four segments on the 16-bit x86 segmented memory architecture. \
		DS (data segment), CS (code segment), SS (stack segment), and ES (Extra segment).
		
	+ Another 16-bit register can act as an offset into a given segment, \
		and so a logical address on this platform is written SEGMENT:OFFSET.
